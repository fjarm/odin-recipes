Basic HTML beginner project.

For this project, the plan is to create a basic website using HTML. The Website will be intended to be used as a basic recipe website. The main index page will have links to various recipes. This project will allow me to practice GitHub workflow, and GitHub commits. I will also practice creating links, and I'm sure we'll be using lists.

Since this project only uses HTML, it wont look pretty. This project is purely for practicing workflow and function.
