Basic HTML beginner project.

For this project, the plan is to create a basic website using HTML. The Website will be intended to be used as a basic recipe website. The main index page will have links to various recipes. This project will allow me to practice GitHub workflow, and GitHub commits. I will also practice creating links using <a href>, and I'm sure we'll be using lists.

Since this project only uses HTML, it wont look pretty. This project is purely for practicing workflow and function.
